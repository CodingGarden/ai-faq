{"prompt":"Why don't you stream on YouTube anymore?","completion":"\nI switched to twitch fully at the end of April 2020. My contract with twitch restricts me from cross streaming to Twitch + YouTube simultaneously.\n\nThere are several reasons I switched to twitch:\n* Better APIs / Integrations\n* Lower Latency\n* Stream Clips (created by anyone)\n* Community support\n  * The majority of live coders in this space are on Twitch, not YouTube\n* Community features like teams, raids, hosts and watch parties.\n* More emotes!!\n\n"}

{"prompt":"Why is everyone typing !drop?","completion":"\nThis is the drop game! The garden of seedlings at the bottom center of my screen are all of the drops that have landed there.\n\nYou can:\n* Drop a seed: !drop\n* Drop your twitch avatar: !drop me\n* Drop any twitch / BTTV / FFZ emote: !drop codinggHeart\n* Drop an emoji: !drop 💚\n\nThis game was coded live on stream and was inspired by the [PenguinDrop](https://github.com/instafluff/PenguinDrop) game created by [Instafluff](https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff). More on that in the [stream overlays section](#how-did-you-make-those-overlays--chat-window).\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Why is the chat in slow mode?","completion":"\nI used to be able to respond to every single message in the chat, but this is just not possible anymore. Slow mode gives me a fighting chance 😅.\n\nThe mods (and I) adjust slow mode based on how many people are watching and how busy the chat is.\n\nWhatever the slow mode is set to, use that time to construct a beautiful and thoughtful message instead of just spamming.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"How is your chair green?","completion":"\n[I use a blue screen](https://coding.garden/gear/). In the early days, I used a green screen, but with the garden theme, things are often green, so I switched to a blue screen.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What are cjClap POGGERS PogU OMEGALUL etc. I see in the chat?","completion":"\nThese are [Better Twitch TV](https://betterttv.com/), [Frankerfacez](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) or [7tv](https://7tv.app/) emotes! You can install a browser extension that renders these types of emotes all across twitch.

Some older live streams are on the main [Coding Garden YouTube](https://youtube.com/codinggarden) channel as well.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Can I be a mod?","completion":"\nThe first rule of being a mod, is you do not ask to be a mod.\n\nAll of my mods are long time viewers of the stream, have gained my trust over time and positively contribute to the streams / chat.\n\nWe also have a channel point reward called \"Request to be a mod\" that costs 200K seedlings. Redeeming this will start the conversation, but there are no guarantees. The points will be refunded regardless of the outcome.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Why are you standing (sometimes)?","completion":"\n* It keeps my energy / enthusiasm up.\n* I can point at the screen weather man style.\n\n\n"}
{"prompt":"How long have you been doing this?","completion":"\nI have been live streaming for 4.5+ years.\n\nMy first live stream was broadcasted to [YouTube on February 19th, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aql62xliRzE). My YouTube channel had about 300 subscribers at the time, and there were a max of 3 people in the chat.\n\nBetween February 2018 and October 2019, I did **158** live streams on YouTube only.\n\nOn October 2nd, 2019, I did my [first live stream on Twitch + YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1wRSB_MpzE). I was using some open source software called [docker-multistreamer](https://github.com/jprjr/docker-multistreamer) to do this. At the time I was not a twitch affiliate, so I was able to cross-stream without violating any terms.\n\nThis began my slow transition from YouTube to Twitch.\n\nBetween October 2019 and April 2020, I did **100** live streams on YouTube + Twitch.\n\nOn April 27th 2020, I signed the Twitch affiliate agreement and started streaming only on Twitch.\n\nBetween April 2020 and July 2020, I did **52** live streams on Twitch only.\n\nOn July 20th 2020, I got accepted into the Twitch Partner program.\n\nIn total between February 2018 and November 14th 2022, I have done **528** live streams.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"How did you start live streaming?","completion":"\nI'm an educator at heart. My live streams started as a way for me to continue teaching outside of the classroom.\n\nI taught Full Stack Web Development at a code school for ~3 years. I taught 150+ students and 6+ cohorts. That's over 700+ in person lessons, breakouts, presentations and 1 on 1s with students. During this time, I honed my teaching, mentoring and presentation skills. My live streams are very similar to how I ran and structured my in person lessons.\n\nMy students were often at many different stages of learning, so my teaching style reflected that. Instead of pre-planning all of my lessons, my lessons were planned the day of, based on where my students were and based on what they needed to learn next. This was the beginnings of my improvisational style. My lessons were often live code-alongs, and I often would need to quickly code an example from scratch to demonstrate a concept.\n\nMy [early YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_i0obccy3uwR6ZYa7QE03xDRAqs4Aso) were actually meant for my students. I was teaching a class of 30 students with 1 assistant, and we needed a way to efficiently provide help to all of the students in a timely manner. My YouTube videos were a way for me to \"clone\" myself. If a student was having trouble with a topic, I could point them to a video.\n\nI took a 3 month break from that job in early 2018, and my live streams were a way for me to continue teaching outside of the classroom. I returned to that job in mid 2018, but I continued to live stream in my spare time, and continued to grow my channel.\n\n> In terms of getting started with live streaming hardware / tech / logistics: I used to play and record music, so I already had microphones / audio recording equipment on hand. Also, before I began live streaming myself, I had started to live stream my students' project presentations, so I already had an HDMI capture card on hand. I'm also just generally knowledgeable / handy when it comes to computers / tech, so setting up live stream equipment was second nature for me.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Where did the name Coding Garden come from?","completion":"\nThe same way I name most of my projects 😀. I [searched for a domain](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=coding)!\n\nThe [coding.garden](https://coding.garden) domain was available, so I went with that. The garden theme is nice because it plays right into the idea of growing as a software developer.\n\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Are you self taught? Do you have a computer science degree?","completion":"\nI have a highly technical education / background, but I've been self learning all my life. I started teaching myself basic programming and building websites when I was in middle school.\n\nI have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. My university did not offer any CS specializations at the time, but I did take a few courses in Cybersecurity / Computer Forensics.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"How long have you been coding?","completion":"\nOver 18 years! I started coding HTML / CSS websites as a kid. Learned Java, C, C++ in college. Wrote C# / .NET desktop applications for a while. Started learning modern web technologies in my spare time, taught JavaScript full stack web development for 3+ years, worked as a Chief Full Stack Engineer / Architect for 3+ years and now I am a full time gardener.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What do you do for a living?","completion":"\nIn June 2022 I started creating content full time!\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What does CJ stand for?","completion":"\n_Everyone_ has always called me **CJ**. Just call me **CJ**.\n\nPlease don't ask about my first / last name, or share my first / last name in the chat if you do know it.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"How old are you?","completion":"\nThe oldest I've ever been.\n\nYou don't want to know. You will either be disappointed, surprised, or it will have no effect. Either way, you really don't want to know.\n\nI usually say I'm 75+ on stream as a joke. I'm a bit younger than that. Please don't ask about my age, or share my age in the chat if you do know it.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Who is that dog on the getting started screen? Do you really have a Saint Bernard?","completion":"\nI do have a dog! His name is Panzer. He is a ~6.75 year old Saint Bernard. He weighs about 130+ lbs. He is a very good boy, but he is afraid of the stairs, so he will not come down stairs to where I stream.\n\nI was streaming at an undisclosed location once, and [he did make an appearance](https://clips.twitch.tv/FantasticFreezingCrabBudStar).\n\nI also did an IRL dog walk you can watch [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1633203073)\n\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Why don't you use VIM?","completion":"\nSeveral reasons:\n* The days of needing to ssh into a remote computer to edit code in a terminal are [long gone](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).\n* Terminal based editors make it very hard for viewers to follow what is happening, especially beginners.\n* I prefer to not memorize specific / custom keyboard shortcuts and instead rely on [global / universal keyboard shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/w3cj/022081eda22081b82c52).\n* I also prefer to use the intellisense / autocomplete / snippets provided by VSCode. I realize these can be setup in VIM, but this requires a lot of setup / configuration / tweaking that I do not want to do.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Why do you prefer Vue.js?","completion":"\nI have talked about this in depth on many different live streams.\n\nHere are a few timestamped links that will answer your question:\n* [Overview of Vue (with React developers in mind)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sba3S4SD4IE&t=7205s)\n* [When should I choose Vue over React / Angular](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/700224339?t=0h36m39s)\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What do you think of Tailwind?","completion":"\nMost of the things I build on stream are rapid prototypes or things where I do not want to write the styles from scratch.\n\nTailwind itself is NOT a component library or CSS framework. It is a utility library that requires you to assemble all of its utility classes to create your own styles. If I were to use tailwind for the types of apps I build on stream, I would need to write all of the styles from scratch. In most situations I do not want to do that.\n\nI know that tailwind based frameworks exist, like TailwindUI, Daisy UI, Flowbite or [many of the others](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tailwind+component+libraries&t=ffab&ia=web), but I do not have much experience with these and prefer to use things I know like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) or [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/).\n\nAlso, Tailwind is a type of CSS developer experience. I do not like the experience it provides. I prefer [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [SFC](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-spec.html#sfc-syntax-specification) styles or [CSS in JS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss?v=v10.9.2) much more than Tailwind itself.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What is your preferred deployment method?","completion":"\nIt _really_ depends. Some services I use:\n* [Surge](https://surge.sh/)\n  * Good for static websites (hosted on a CDN)\n* [Vercel formerly now.sh](https://vercel.com/)\n  * Good for static websites (hosted on a CDN)\n  * Serverless functions\n* [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/)\n  * Cheap VPS, requires linux system administration / setup\n\n"}

CS50 from Harvard is well known and really good: https://cs50.harvard.edu/\n\nJust search [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=learn+to+web+development)!\n\nI recorded a short video going over these resources [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqeMsPm71RY).\n\n\nI have done a live stream where I setup my Macbook for development from scratch and answer several of the questions you see below [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ZbslLnshw).\n\nI documented all of the settings and apps I use [here](https://github.com/codinggarden/mac-setup)\n\n"}

My setup these days is mostly the same, I just use a desktop gaming PC for streaming instead of a gaming laptop, and I stream at home in my basement instead of in an office space.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What Macbook do you have?","completion":"\nI have the 2021 14\" Macbook Pro\n\nThese are the specs at a glance:\n* Apple M1 Pro\n* 16GB RAM\n* 500GB SSD\n\nRead more about this Macbook [here](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-m1-pro-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-14-2021-specs.html)\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Why do you use a Mac?","completion":"\nEverything just works™️ on my Mac. I spent 6+ years in Windows IT support. I've used Windows 95, 98, XP, Me, 7, Vista, 8 and 10. The amount of things that have gone wrong on my Windows machines is immeasurable. Most of my old windows laptops have become linux machines. I prefer Ubuntu because I'm used to it and it mostly just works.\n\nMy Macbook is the only thing from the Apple ecosystem:\n* I used a 2015 Macbook Pro for 7 years. I finally upgraded to a 14\" M1 Pro in January 2023.\n* I don't have an icloud account.\n* I don't use siri.\n* I have some old iPhones I use for testing occasionally, but I use an Android phone as my daily driver.\n\nOther reasons I use a mac:\n* OS X is based on FreeBSD.\n  * Most tools / utilities for linux are supported / work out of the box.\n  * I can use a native Bash shell.\n* I can run Xcode and build / test iOS / mac apps without the need for any 3rd party tools / services.\n* I do creative things outside of coding. The Adobe Suite, Ableton live / logic pro all work flawlessly on my Mac.\n* If I want to use Windows / Linux, I can dual boot or use a virtual machine.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Are you left-handed? Why do you use a left handed mouse?","completion":"\nI am not left-handed. I started using a left handed mouse about 8 years ago when I started getting wrist pain in my right wrist.\n\nI continue to use a left-handed mouse today as this continues to prevent issues with my right hand.\n\nYou can read more about the mouse I use on the [gear page](https://coding.garden/gear/).\n\n"}

The [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/about/) is a great organization with a great cause.\n\nI switched to Google Chrome for a while, but Firefox has caught up in terms of performance / features, so I'm back to Firefox.\n\nI use the following Privacy Related Extensions. Firefox + these extensions is my preferred way of browsing the web instead of using a browser that has these features \"bundled\" in:\n* Adblocker - [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)\n* Tracker Blocker - [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)\n  * Firefox now includes tracker blocking, but I leave Privacy Badger enabled.\n* [Cookie Autodelete](https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete)\n  * Removes cookies from websites that are not in my whitelist whenever a tab is closed. An additional precaution to tracker blocking.\n* [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/)\n  * Caches CDN links locally and intercepts requests to serve from the cache. Prevents CDNs from tracking you across websites.\n* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)\n  * This isn't needed as much these days, as most websites use HTTPS, but this prevents certain redirect / plain text attacks from occurring.\n\nThemes / customization:\n* Custom CSS on websites - [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)\n* Custom JavaScript on websites - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)\n\n"}
